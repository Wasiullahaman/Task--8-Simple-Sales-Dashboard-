# 🧾 Simple Sales Dashboard using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of Task 8 from the Data Analyst Internship Program.  
The goal was to create a **simple, clean, and interactive dashboard** that helps visualize **sales performance** based on different parameters such as **region, category, and time (month-year)**.

The dashboard is designed in **Power BI**, using a Superstore-style dataset. It gives a clear summary of how the business is performing in different areas.

## 🎯 Objective
To practice and demonstrate basic data visualization and storytelling skills using Power BI.

### Key Goals:
- Visualize **monthly sales trends**
- Compare **sales across regions**
- Analyze **category-wise performance**
- Use **interactive filters** to explore data

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
The dataset includes the following key columns:
- **Order Date** – Date when the order was placed
- **Sales** – Amount of money earned
- **Profit** – Earnings after cost
- **Category** – Product category (e.g., Furniture, Technology)
- **Region** – Geographical sales region (e.g., East, West)

## 📊 Dashboard Components
The Power BI dashboard contains the following visuals:

1. **Line Chart**  
   Shows how sales changed over different months.

2. **Bar Chart**  
   Compares sales across different regions.

3. **Donut Chart**  
   Shows the percentage share of sales by category.

4. **Slicer (Filter)**  
   Allows users to filter the entire dashboard by Region.

All visuals use a clean, minimal color scheme to improve readability and presentation quality.

## 🔍 Key Insights
Based on the dashboard, here are some important observations:

1. **West region** had the highest overall sales throughout the year.
2. The **Technology category** generated the most revenue.
3. **November and December** saw the highest sales, possibly due to holiday demand.
4. The **South region** showed the lowest profit margins compared to others.
